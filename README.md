# TimeFinder
A tool for multiple people to sync their calendars.

## About
The idea is to making it easier to find time for eg. projects, meetings and social activities when there are many people and different individual schedules involved. 

## How to use
Select your free time/busy time by highlighting the slots in the calendar. Write your name and click submit to see your entry in the list down below. You also see a stretched-out version of the calendar that clearly shows overlap between people's free time (green areas).
Clicking 'Get optimal time' selects the time slots where most people are free. You will only get a response if there are entries made and it will show up as a blue area in the calendar.
