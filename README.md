# TimeFinder
A tool for multiple people to sync their calendars.

## About
The idea is to making it easier to find time for eg. projects, meetings and social activities when there are many people and different individual schedules involved. 

## How to use
Select your free time/busy time by highlighting the slots in the calendar. Write your name and click submit to see your entry in the list down below. You also see a stretched-out version of the calendar that clearly shows overlap between people's free time (green areas).
Clicking 'Get optimal time' selects the time slots where most people are free. You will only get a response if there are entries made and it will show up as a blue area in the calendar.

## Sample usage
Five friends want to meet for making plans for a party. They all have very different schedules and therefore they use TimeFinder in order to see when most people can show up for the meeting. 
Anna is busy only on the weekend, so she clicks 'Select busy time' and turn all the weekend slots to red. Ben has the mornings free and so he 'selects free time', making the slots from 8.00 to 10.00 each day green. Charlie is busy every second day, but free on the weekend, therefore selecting all Mon, Wed and Fri slots with red color. Dana could well have the meeting on whatever day, so she clicks 'select busy time' but make no selections in the calendar. Eric is busy every day except Thursday and Friday, so he turns the slots of those days to green. They will now be able to see the results table showing all calendar selections under each other:
